## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the Fake News Detection project on GitHub. This repository contains a tool for detecting fake news using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. This README file will guide you through the setup, usage, and contribution guidelines for this project.

Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, and this project aims to provide a reliable means of identifying and classifying news articles as either authentic or potentially fake.

## 2. Description <a name="description"></a>

The Fake News Detection tool in this repository is designed to perform the following tasks:

- Text preprocessing to clean and prepare news articles for analysis.
- Feature extraction and engineering to effectively represent news articles.
- Training and using machine learning models (such as a neural network or random forest classifier) for classification.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Real-time or batch mode for news article classification.

This project combines various techniques to provide a robust solution for detecting misinformation and disinformation in news articles.
